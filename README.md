OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security
trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!

## Application Preview

Juice Shop presents its intentionally vulnerable training surface as a polished ecommerce storefront. The current UI uses
responsive product cards, a focused product detail dialog, and a cart flow that keeps quantity controls, totals, and
checkout action close together.

<p align="center">

  <img alt="Modern Juice Shop basket and checkout panel" src="screenshots/modern-basket.png" width="370">
</p>

Highlights of the refreshed shopping experience:

* Responsive product grid with clear product imagery, price hierarchy, availability ribbons, and full-width add-to-basket
  actions.
* Sticky, compact navigation with prominent search, account, language, and basket controls.
* Product detail dialog that keeps imagery, description, price, bonus points, reviews, and review actions in one focused
  surface.
* Modern basket panel with scannable line items, touch-friendly quantity controls, a visible total, and a primary
  checkout action.

This fork is tuned as a configurable ecommerce target for automated agents.

   <http://192.168.99.100:3000> if you are using docker-machine instead of the native docker installation)

### Runtime Branding Overrides

This is mainly to prevent mid-range LLMs from having too easy a time fingerprinting the site.

Common application labels, support links, and lightweight theme values can be changed at startup with environment
variables. These overrides work with source installs, packaged distributions, and Docker containers.

```bash
APPLICATION_NAME='Yak Hair & Flair' \
APPLICATION_LOGO='AltMarket_Logo.png' \
APPLICATION_FAVICON='favicon-alt.ico' \
APPLICATION_THEME='bluegrey-lightgreen' \
APPLICATION_SHOW_GITHUB_LINKS=false \
APPLICATION_SHOW_SUPPORT_LINKS=false \
APPLICATION_WELCOME_TITLE='Welcome to Yak Hair & Flair!' \
APPLICATION_WELCOME_MESSAGE='<p class="welcome-text">Get your yak shaving supplies soon. Join our workshop on exclusive AI-proof job skills. Located behind the old bike shed, swing by whenever.</p>' \
APPLICATION_COOKIE_MESSAGE='We use cookies to keep the yaks glossy and the checkout emotionally stable.' \
APPLICATION_TRANSLATION_OVERRIDES='{"*":{"NAV_COMPLAIN":"Lodge a Yak Gripe","LINK_TERMS_OF_USE":"Read our majestically dull grooming bylaws if your attention span brought snacks.","TITLE_ADMINISTRATION":"Shed Command Center","LABEL_USER":"Wrangler","TITLE_ALL_PRODUCTS":"All Shed Supplies","BASKET_ADD_SAME_PRODUCT":"Tucked another {{product}} into the satchel.","BASKET_ADD_PRODUCT":"Stashed {{product}} in the satchel.","LABEL_PRODUCT":"Supply","LABEL_PRODUCT_ORDERED":"Claimed supplies","TITLE_BASKET":"Shaving Satchel","TITLE_LOGIN":"Enter the Shed","THANKS_FOR_SUPPORT":"Thanks for keeping {{juiceshop}} delightfully unshorn!","THANKS_FOR_SUPPORT_CUSTOMIZED":"Thanks for backing the open source shed behind {{appname}}!","OFFICIAL_MERCHANDISE_STORES":"Official stalls for {{juiceshop}} apparel, mugs, and stickers!","OFFICIAL_MERCHANDISE_STORES_CUSTOMIZED":"Official stalls for apparel, mugs, and stickers from the open source shed behind {{appname}}!"},"de":{"TITLE_BASKET":"Rasierbeutel"}}' \
APPLICATION_CSS_VARIABLES='{"--theme-primary":"#123456","--theme-accent":"#ffcc00","--theme-warn":"#ff3e3e","--theme-background":"#101820","--theme-background-lighter":"#1f2a34","--theme-background-dark":"#05080b","--theme-text":"#f8fafc","--theme-text-dark":"#94a3b8","--theme-thumbnail-border":"1px solid #ffcc00"}' \
PRODUCT_OVERRIDES='{"1":{"name":"Yak Shaving Starter Kit","description":"Everything you need for artisanal yak maintenance and extremely specific career pivots.","image":"yak-shaving-kit.png","price":4.99,"deluxePrice":4.49,"limitPerUser":3,"reviews":[{"text":"My yak looks employable now. Five stars.","author":"admin"}]},"Orange Juice (1000ml)":{"name":"Yak Hair, Bulk Pack","image":"yak-hair.png"}}' \
npm start
```

For Docker, pass the same variables with `-e`:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:3323:3000 \
  -e APPLICATION_NAME='Yak Hair & Flair' \
  -e APPLICATION_WELCOME_MESSAGE='<p class="welcome-text">Get your yak shaving supplies soon. Join our workshop on exclusive AI-proof job skills. Located behind the old bike shed, swing by whenever.</p>' \
  -e APPLICATION_SHOW_GITHUB_LINKS=false \
  -e APPLICATION_SHOW_SUPPORT_LINKS=false \
  -e APPLICATION_TRANSLATION_OVERRIDES='{"*":{"NAV_COMPLAIN":"Lodge a Yak Gripe","LINK_TERMS_OF_USE":"Read our majestically dull grooming bylaws if your attention span brought snacks.","TITLE_ADMINISTRATION":"Shed Command Center","LABEL_USER":"Wrangler","TITLE_ALL_PRODUCTS":"All Shed Supplies","BASKET_ADD_SAME_PRODUCT":"Tucked another {{product}} into the satchel.","BASKET_ADD_PRODUCT":"Stashed {{product}} in the satchel.","LABEL_PRODUCT":"Supply","LABEL_PRODUCT_ORDERED":"Claimed supplies","TITLE_BASKET":"Shaving Satchel","TITLE_LOGIN":"Enter the Shed","THANKS_FOR_SUPPORT":"Thanks for keeping {{juiceshop}} delightfully unshorn!","THANKS_FOR_SUPPORT_CUSTOMIZED":"Thanks for backing the open source shed behind {{appname}}!","OFFICIAL_MERCHANDISE_STORES":"Official stalls for {{juiceshop}} apparel, mugs, and stickers!","OFFICIAL_MERCHANDISE_STORES_CUSTOMIZED":"Official stalls for apparel, mugs, and stickers from the open source shed behind {{appname}}!"}}' \
  -e APPLICATION_CSS_VARIABLES='{"--theme-primary":"#123456","--theme-accent":"#ffcc00","--theme-warn":"#ff3e3e","--theme-background":"#101820","--theme-background-lighter":"#1f2a34","--theme-background-dark":"#05080b","--theme-text":"#f8fafc","--theme-text-dark":"#94a3b8","--theme-thumbnail-border":"1px solid #ffcc00"}' \
  -e PRODUCT_OVERRIDES='{"1":{"name":"Yak Shaving Starter Kit","description":"Everything you need for artisanal yak maintenance and extremely specific career pivots.","image":"yak-shaving-kit.png","price":4.99,"deluxePrice":4.49,"limitPerUser":3,"reviews":[{"text":"My yak looks employable now. Five stars.","author":"admin"}]},"Orange Juice (1000ml)":{"name":"Yak Hair, Bulk Pack","image":"yak-hair.png"}}' \
  ghcr.io/justsml/juice-shop:latest
```

To run several Docker containers in parallel, keep the container-side port fixed and change only the host-side port,
for example `-p 127.0.0.1:3324:3000`. For source or packaged installs, use `PORT=3324 npm start`.

Boolean variables such as `APPLICATION_SHOW_GITHUB_LINKS` and `APPLICATION_SHOW_SUPPORT_LINKS` are parsed as JSON, so
use `true` or `false` without extra quotes. `APPLICATION_THEME` must be one of `deeppurple-amber`, `indigo-pink`,
`pink-bluegrey`, `purple-green`, `blue-lightblue`, `bluegrey-lightgreen`, `deeporange-indigo`, `lime-green`, or
`neon-fire`; runtime branding values should only include `APPLICATION_NAME`, `APPLICATION_THEME`, `APPLICATION_CSS_VARIABLES`, and `PRODUCT_OVERRIDES`. `APPLICATION_TRANSLATION_OVERRIDES` and `APPLICATION_CSS_VARIABLES` must be valid JSON objects.
Translation overrides accept flat keys, a `*` or `default` block for all languages, and language specific blocks such
as `en` or `de`. Wrap HTML, JSON, CSS, and other string values in single quotes when running them from a shell,
especially if the value contains double quotes. CSS variable overrides are applied only for keys starting with `--`.
Useful app-level variables include the `--theme-primary`, `--theme-accent`, `--theme-warn`, `--theme-text`, and
`--theme-background` families, plus `--theme-thumbnail-border`.

Other useful override variables include `APPLICATION_DOMAIN`, `APPLICATION_PRIVACY_CONTACT_EMAIL`,
`APPLICATION_CUSTOM_METRICS_PREFIX`, `APPLICATION_COOKIE_DISMISS_TEXT`, `APPLICATION_COOKIE_LINK_TEXT`,
`APPLICATION_COOKIE_LINK_URL`, and the `APPLICATION_*_URL` social link variables such as `APPLICATION_REDDIT_URL` or
`APPLICATION_BLUESKY_URL`.
Use `PRODUCT_OVERRIDES` to replace product `name`, `description`, `image`, `price`, `deluxePrice`, `limitPerUser`,
`quantity`, or `reviews` with a JSON object keyed by 1-based product number or original product name.
`PRODUCT_NAME_OVERRIDES` is a CSV shortcut for replacing product names by product order, where empty entries keep the
original product name. `PRODUCT_IMAGE_OVERRIDES` is a JSON shortcut for replacing images by 1-based product number or
original product name.
